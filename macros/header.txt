*title: Jet fragmentation transverse momentum measurements from di-hadron correlations in  $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV pp and $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=5.02$ TeV p-Pb collisions
*comment: CERN-LHC. The transverse structure of jets was studied via jet fragmentation transverse momentum ($j_{\rm T}$) distributions, obtained using two-particle correlations in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, measured with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The highest transverse momentum particle in each event is used as the trigger particle and the region $3 < p_{\rm T} < 15$ ~GeV/$c$ is explored in this study.
